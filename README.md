##Motor Poster Adaptingpicture

This project was about creating an motorized poster or object, which is supposed to react on the room and the people without a direct input like a mouse or keyboard. 

I was curious about the idea to construct an moving painting, adjust oneself to parameters of the room or the people like noise, light and movement.

sketch of idea "Adaptingpicture"

After premeditating the result I wanted to get and listing anything I might need, I decidet to bound my aims and reduced the to measured parameters to the movement. The ocean in the picture should be partitioned in six pieces back-mounted on moving circeling metals. The circle size and should vary to give the observer the plastic feeling of a three-dimensional view. To fit out my Painting with varied properties like different small plants and a building, I sift through several model-making stores and flea markets and startet to paint the waves. 
The frame was built by my boyfriend, who works as a carpenter and was varnished by different layers of spray paint. Because of the different	chemical composition, the paints reacted with eachother and formed an interesting texture and made the frame aging for/about/h√§? decades.
