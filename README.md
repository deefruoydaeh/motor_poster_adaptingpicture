##Motor Poster Adaptingpicture

This project was about creating an motorized poster or object, which is supposed to react to the room and the people without a direct input like a mouse or keyboard. 

I was curious about the idea to construct a moving painting, adjusted to parameters of the room or the people like noise, light and movement.

sketch of idea "Adaptingpicture"

##Prerequisite

1. **engineering**

  12V engine
  
  Sharp distance sensor 100cm to 500cm 
  
  Aduino board
  
  12V power supply
  
  several toothed wheels 
  
  metal bars
  

2. **frame**

  self-built picture frame with glass panel
  
  different gold spray-paint for vintage look


3. **requisites**

  polystyrene block for mountain
  
  model-making
  
  artificial turfs
  
  many different trees
  
  house
  
  fence
  
  six self-painted waves
  
  self-painted sky
  
  angles and screws to bolt it all together


##Preparations

After constructing a concept and listing the items I might need, I decided to bound my aims and adjusted the measured parameters to the movement. The ocean in the picture should be partitioned in six pieces back-mounted on moving circeling metals. The circle sizes should vary to allow the observer a plastic feeling of a three-dimensional view. 

To fit out my painting with varied properties like different small plants and a building, I sift through several model-making stores and flea markets and started to paint the waves. 
The frame was built by my boyfriend, who works as a carpenter. To give it an authentic look, I coated it with different layers of spray paint. Because of the different	chemical compositions, the colors reacted with eachother and formed an interesting texture and makes the frame appear aged for decades.

The machanics were pretty tricky. I first I tried to solve the problems of an allways exact and synchronal flow of the waves by different arrangements of V-belts. Unfortunately that did not work out and I switched to an more effectiv but not that elegant solution. I conected all toothed wheels to one big system. This way I had every movement synchronal, but also enlarged the resistence. But finally it worked out and was ready to get to the engine.

Distance sensor are pretty fragil. Mine got broken some days befor the presentation. Therefore I had to switch spontaneous to the more improper unit from aduino. The code was written by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas and edits among others the variable the signal of the sensor. Depending on that it regulates the movement by defining the energy output. 

The weight of the painted waves on the mechanics made it to hard for the engine to move at all. But fortunatly mechanic oil like WD-40 gave it the nesessary frictionlessness to work out. Not as smooth as planned, the person had to get very close to the sensor to induce the required values and make the ocean move, but it performed satisfying and charmed observer and made them laugh.
